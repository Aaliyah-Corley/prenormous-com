# Prenormous

We’re building the venture firm for culture.

We collect great people before anyone knows their name.  
Artists. Builders. Operators. The prenormous.

If you’re one of them, we want you.

## The Thesis

The most valuable collectible has never been the Hall of Fame plaque.  
It’s always been the rookie card—signed before the first game.

That value was always there. In the before-time. When they were prenormous.

Patronage died because there was no liquid market. You had to lock capital for decades with no price signal and no exit.

Crypto fixes that.

Now you can:
- Create real scarcity (limited artifacts from the before-time)  
- Add tokenized liquidity (24/7 markets, fractional ownership)  
- Tie funds to measurable cultural missions (classrooms, exhibitions, penetration KPIs)  
- Keep most assets on-chain while real-world sales create honest price discovery

Money backed by meaning.  
An asset class that tracks cultural significance as it compounds.

We call it **Cultural Gold**.

## The Proof-of-Concept We’re Shipping Right Now

**PLUM** — a debut novelist.  
10,000 signed, serialized, never-reprinted first editions. Each tokenized.  
Proceeds fund a 20-year mission: 100,000+ classroom distributions with aligned curriculum.

Tokenomics are fully designed.  
Manuscript is finished.  
Launch: Q2–Q3 2026.

If PLUM works, we’ve validated the entire asset class.

But we’re not a book launch company.

We’re the first mover in a category that will be worth tens (maybe hundreds) of billions.

## The Company We’re Actually Building

Someone needs to:
- Curate prenormous talent across every vertical  
- Build the rails (provenance, physical↔crypto linkage, settlement standards)  
- Create the markets (primary drops, secondary liquidity, index products)  
- Coordinate capital (portfolio of 50–500 shots)  
- Own the brand that means “this is the legitimate Cultural Gold play”

That someone is going to be a new venture firm.

I’m starting it.

I have the first project fully architected.  
I have the thesis.  
I have the name.

I don’t yet have the full team or the second rookie-card artist.

That’s the point of this site.

## Who I’m Looking For (right now, pre-everything)

1. **The next prenormous artist**  
   If you’re 14–24, shipping something insane that the world hasn’t priced yet, and you’re willing to create the scarce artifact before anyone cares—I’ll back you next.

2. **Co-conspirators**  
   People who see the Sequoia-level opportunity in cultural gold and want to help build the firm from day zero.  
   Especially:
   - Technical architects (smart contracts, provenance, physical-crypto bridging)  
   - Curators / talent scouts with god-tier taste  
   - Operators who’ve already shipped hard things at 18  
   - Anyone smart, fast, and fun to be around

Want in?

1. Pick any artifact you’ve made (song, repo, painting, meme, 40-second TikTok—literally whatever).  
2. Host it somewhere I can see without a login.  
3. Email the link + a 50-word footnote that tells me *why this moment was before time*.  

I reply to every single one.
Average response time right now: 11 hours.
If it’s a fit, we jump on a 15-min call.

Send the artifact. Consensus comes later.
